<h2> <strong>My favorite animals</strong></h2>
</body>
My favorite animals are:
<ul>Golden retrievers</ul><ul>German shepards</ul><ul>Husky</ul>
These are my favorite animals because I own all three and they are the best they are always energetic and fun to be around. They can also be cuddly and loving even though they are big and hyperactive dogs. Probably my favorite one is the German shepard Memphis he always gives me a run for my money but is also really cuddley.
