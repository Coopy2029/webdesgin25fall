<h1> How To Make A Burger</h1>
<p>To make a burger you will need the following ingredients: <li>ground beef, salt, pepper, burger buns, and your choice of toppings.</li><li>First, you will need to form the ground beef into patties. Make sure to season the patties with salt and pepper on both sides.</li> <li>Next, heat a grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. </li><li>Once the grill or skillet is hot, place the patties on it and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare burgers. If you prefer your burgers more well-done, cook them for an additional 1-2 minutes on each side.</li><li>While the burgers are cooking, you can toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li><li>Once the burgers are cooked to your desired level of doneness, remove them from the grill or skillet and let them rest for a few minutes. Finally, assemble your burger by placing the patty on the bottom bun and adding your choice of toppings</li></p>
<p>The reason I decided to choose burgers because they are my favorite to eat and I would eat it anytime of the day I always use to like them when I was little</p>
