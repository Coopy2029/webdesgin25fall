      <p>
        One major con of basketball is the high risk of injury, such as ankle sprains, knee problems, or overuse injuries from constant jumping and quick direction changes. While this can be a drawback, it can also help make players better by teaching them the importance of proper training, conditioning, and recovery. Players learn to strengthen their bodies, improve flexibility, and focus on correct technique to reduce injury risk. This awareness encourages smarter practice habits, better discipline, and a deeper understanding of physical health, which ultimately helps players become stronger, more resilient, and more well-rounded athletes.
