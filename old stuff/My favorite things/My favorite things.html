<br><H3>Cuddly,Loving,Energetic,</H3>
My favorite animals are:
<ol><li>Golden retrievers<li>German shepards<li>Husky</ol>
<p>These are my favorite animals because I own all three and they are the best they are always energetic and fun to be around. They can also be cuddly and loving even though they are big and hyperactive dogs. Probably my favorite one is the German shepard Memphis he always gives me a run for my money but is also really cuddley.</p>

<br><H2>My favorite Movies</H2>
<br><h3>Comedy,Action,Truimph</h3>
My favorite movies are:
<ol>
    <li>Happy Gilmore</li>
    <li>Happy Gilmore 2</li>
    <li>Jurassic Park</li>
</ol>
<p>These are my favorite ones because they talk about Gilmore finding his love for golf and finding a wife and becoming good in golf and then in the second movie he kills his wife with a golf ball and becomes depressed and then comes back to golf after someone is trying to ruin and then saves it, and then in Jurassic it talks about a billionaire trying to make dinosaurs and they go to an island and they get abonded because there crew is killed and then the dinosaurs try to kill them to but they find a boat and escape. But only the people who want to use the cure for good live. Sell it to all companies instead of keeping it for there own and making money off of it.</p>
